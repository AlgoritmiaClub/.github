Algoritmia is a student club dedicated to fostering technical skills and problem-solving abilities among its members. Throughout our journey, we have become the largest programming club in western Mexico 🇲🇽, encouraging personal and collective growth through weekly gatherings held on Saturdays. During these meetings, students come together to solve problems, engage in friendly conversations, and exchange knowledge.

## Our Slogan: "Connect the Dots" ✏️

Our slogan, "Connect the Dots," is symbolized by our logo, which depicts a binary tree with one side larger than the other. This asymmetry represents the magic of our club, where each member contributes their unique dots of knowledge to the community. As we come together, we connect these individual dots, forming a comprehensive understanding that helps us achieve our goals.

## Weekly Gatherings ⏰

Every Saturday, our club members convene for a collaborative and enriching experience. During these weekly sessions, we dedicate time to tackle coding challenges, discuss algorithmic approaches, and share insights. Through this collective effort, we foster an environment that encourages learning, problem-solving, and the exchange of ideas.
